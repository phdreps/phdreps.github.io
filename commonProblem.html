                    Taking care of yourself can be really challenging while doing your PhD. All of us experience chronic stress due to experiments not working, failure to meet your goals, disappointment and fear surrounding your career and impostor syndrome, just to name a few.
                    When we experience several of them repeatedly it’s hard to process this frustration and stress in a healthy way, and it can feel overwhelming. This can eventually lead to depression.

                    <h2>First step: being aware.</h2> 
                    PhD students have a high risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. In fact, this risk is <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9r2k7/">2.43 times higher in PhD students</a> compared to the highly educated general population. Additionally, <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/nbt.4089">females and gender-nonconforming PhD students</a> are significantly more likely to experience anxiety and depression than their male graduate counterparts. However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/05/men-less-likely-to-get-help--mental-health?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">men are less likely</a> to seek professional or interpersonal help. The high risk in academia, especially for PhD students has been studied and recognized in the <a href="https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/nbt.4089">US</a>, <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2022.html">UK</a> and <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9r2k7">Belgium</a>. Major scientific journals like <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/04/mental-health-academia-too-often-forgotten-footnote-needs-change">Science</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7677/full/nj7677-549a.html">Nature</a> have already called out this phenomenon and it has been written about in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/18/academia-exploitation-university-mental-health-professors-plagiarism">The Guardian</a>.
