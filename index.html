                    <h1>Mental Health Awareness</h1>
                    The mental health series was first published in May 2019
                    <br><br>
                    Doing a PhD is challenging. Not only scientifically, but also personally, as we deal with constant failure, impostor syndrome, own and others’ expectations and just feel overwhelmed. We grow and learn a lot very fast, which together with stressful situations from the lab and private life can sometimes make it hard to cope.
                    <br><br>
                    You are not alone!
                    <br><br>
                    We, your PhD reps, also face these challenges and would like to start an open conversation amongst PhD students to address them. We know all PhD students have these feelings at some point and it is hard to make the best out of them.
