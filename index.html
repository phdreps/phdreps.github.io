                    Doing a PhD is challenging. Not only scientifically, but also personally, as we deal with constant failure, impostor syndrome, own and othersâ€™ expectations and just feel overwhelmed. We grow and learn a lot very fast, which together with stressful situations from the lab and private life can sometimes make it hard to cope.
