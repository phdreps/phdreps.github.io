				Sometimes the solutions are closer than we think. The MDC provides a few options for improving the life quality of its PhD students. Not everything works for everyone but amongst so many options there is probably the one that works for you.

					<h2>Meet your colleagues</h2>
						There are a number of regular events at the MDC that can provide an opportunity for meeting new people such as the classic weekly <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/36131226/en/organisation/life_at_the_mdc/beer">beer hour</a> , the campus <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/40739101/en/events/events/series/kino_unterm_campushimmel">cinema</a>  and monthly PhD rep led events like the pizza dinner and coffee hour. Attending the Christmas and <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/43086075/en/home/newscenter/2018-07/das-war-das-campus-sommerfest-2018#3">Summer parties</a>  and visiting the <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/41707949/en/home/newscenter/2013-12/back-again-the-campus-gl-hwein-hut-opens-for-a-good-cause">Glühwein</a> and the ice cream stands are also great ways to meet people from the institute. <br>
						Also during the stage of writing your thesis, you can combat loneliness and procrastination simultaneously by joining the writing club, held on Thursdays 2-5pm, Haus 84, Room 1401.

					<h2>Sports at the MDC</h2> 
						The on-site gyms offer a quick fitness break for a reasonable price. At Campus Buch,the <a href="http://www.campusvital.de/en/cvcard_info">Campus vital</a> card includes all courses and 24/7 access to the gym, and the HU has a <a href="https://www.hochschulsport.hu-berlin.de/en">gym</a> right next to the BIMSB building in Mitte. <br>
						The MDC also pays for and takes care of your registration for several official runs in Berlin, such as the  <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/43257583/en/home/newscenter/2019-04/voller-erfolg-bei-herbstlichem-wetter-beim-airfield-run-2019">Airfield run</a>, Firmenlauf Berlin (there are still places available for 22nd May, just answer to the mail from <a href="mailto:Sports@mdc-berlin.de"> Sports@mdc-berlin.de</a>!), Berlin Wasserbetriebe and Mauerweglauf. At the runs you get the chance to meet other participants from the MDC or even run as a team. Maria Bikou, a proud MDC PhD student runner, says “I love running, but on top the team spirit is pretty great”. <br>
						If running or the gym is not your cup of tea, you can try <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EllaBYoga/" >Ella´s power Yoga</a>. Ella is a PhD student who runs a FREE MDC yoga class at 19h every Wednesday at BIMSB Campus Mitte. Her generosity has made this class very special, fostering a MDC yoggi community who push each other to go further.

						<h2>Relax</h2>
                            Taking a break from a  stressful week with a massage during the day can be very helpful. At Campus Buch, massages are available from Campus Vital, <a href="http://www.campusvital.de/de/massagen ">booking</a> is easy and you can spend your TK health card there.

                            Sometimes we are too focused on the details of our  project to see the bigger picture. Intensive multi-day courses, workshops, conferences and hackathons can help to create this distance. You can find inspiration for  your own project and even career by stepping away from  your project for a moment, learning something new and meeting new people. We want to particularly highlight the Helmholtz soft skills courses available at the MDC <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/42354599/en/phd/Training">training database</a>.

                            Organising an event like the PhD retreat, <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.info/42872291/en/phd/events/graduation-ceremony">graduation ceremony</a> or a lab outing helps to create a community feeling amongst  PhD students, your lab or the whole MDC.  It also gives you the opportunity to put effort into smaller projects with tangible goals where you can be creative in solving problems together with other PhD students as a team. If you don't want to be involved in the organisation, you can also participate in MDC events, where you can meet others in a relaxed, yet professional, scientific atmosphere. The PhD retreat is a great event where you can practise your presentation skills, reflect on your science, advise and get advised by peers,  make some collaborations on campus, or even just make some new friends! You can register for the PhD retreat <a href="https://www.mdc-berlin.de/phd-retreat-2019">here</a>.

                    Addressing the scary question of “what to do after the PhD” earlier rather than later is really helpful for avoiding leaving this question until it overlaps with the stressful writing and reviewing time. There are several career development courses from the HU (available for all MDC students) in group or individual formats ( email <a href="mailto:hgs-mentoring@hu-berlin.de">hgs-mentoring@hu-berlin.de</a> for current offers).
